## Template Name

What type of project is this template for? (e.g., Music Production, Game Development)

## Target Audience

Who would use this template?

## Proposed Directory Structure

```yaml
- id: example
  name: "Example Template"
  base_path: "~/Projects/Example"
  directories:
    - name: "folder1"
      children:
        - name: "subfolder1"
        - name: "subfolder2"
    - name: "folder2"
```

## Rationale

Why is this directory structure standard for this workflow? Include references to industry conventions if applicable.
